# MRI_IR_Calculator_MatLab

## MRI (D)IR TI/T1++ calculator for MatLab, by Øystein Bech-Aase (formerly Bech Gadmar)
### Based on original code by Atle Bjørnerud, in collaboration with Wibeke Nordhøy

Just run the main .m file in Matlab. Tested mostly on R2018-R2019.
  
TrueT2-DIR is based on Madhuranthakam et al, Mag Res Med 2012 67(1):81-88.
  
For more info, see comments in the IR_Calculator.m file.

## DIR T1 vs TI calculator for LibreOffice Calc by GadOE

With this spreadsheet tool you can calculate TrueT2-DIR TI sequence parameters 
based on measured T1 values, for a predetermined set of other parameters.
  
The T1-vs-TI IR-Calc tool could be deployed in clinical settings without MatLab access. 
Simulations and regressions therein have to be redone for each clinical setting.

Have fun inverting!
